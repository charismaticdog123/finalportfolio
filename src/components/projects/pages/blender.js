    <h1><b><strong>Soft World</strong></b></h1>

   <p class="project-p subtitle"><i>Exploring isometric low-poly characters and settings!</i></p>
   <p class="project-p">These two projects were done for fun as a first step in learning 3D modeling and Blender. The name "Soft World" is inspired by a friend, who commented that the kitchen looks like it would be soft to fall in. As I continue exploring Blender and developing my style, I'm interested in delving into this 'soft' and 'gummy' look that inspires comfort and nostalgia for a world that doesn't exist.</p>

   <h3>Inspiration</h3>
   
   <p class="project-p">This kitchen was my first time working with 3D modeling and it was purely for fun to learn how the basics of 3D modeling in Blender. I followed a YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_PihFbuz4&t=8s">tutorial</a> created by Art by Tran which detailed each step.</p>
   <p class="project-p">I was inspired by the commong Vietnamese breakfast, Bánh Mì Ốp La, which at it's most basic level, consists of runny sunny side up eggs, a baguette, and soy sauce. Needless to say, it's very yummy, and I wanted to include details of my personal background and draw inspiration from my household.</p>
   <h3>The Process</h3>
   <p class="project-p">I started by modelling the larger shapes in the set, beginning with the walls, moving into the fridge, oven, and then counter. The grids on the oven were particularly tricky, but Blender has a very useful mirroring tool.</p>

   <p class="project-p">From there, I moved on to creating the shelf and adding little details!</p>

   <h3>Extra Details</h3>
   <p class="project-p">After getting the initial model down, I started off-roading a little and adding my own details. Since this is inspired by Vietnamese cuisine, it was absolutely necessary to include a fish sauce bottle.</p>

   <p class="project-p">I also drew inspiration by asking friends what they would be if they were an item in a kitchen. Below are the little Easter eggs of their responses:</p>

   <h3>Final Render</h3>
   <p class="project-p">After adding material, specifically color and texture, a backdrop, lighting, and adjusting the cameras, I rendered the final result.</p>

   <h3>Reflection</h3>
   <p class="project-p">Blender is <i>very</i> fun and versatile! The textures are incredible — adding the glass texture to the fish sauce and soy sauce bottles gave it a liquid effect immediately. For a first tutorial and first try at Blender, I am very happy with the result and excited to keep at it!</p>
  
   <h2>Mushie</h2>
   <img src="images/mushie.png" alt="blender render of mushie" width="50%" height="50%"    style={{ marginLeft: "30rem", justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}></img>
   <h3>Inspiration</h3>
   <p className="project-p">As someone who cannot draw, I've unfortunately been very interested in characters, but with little to tangibly show for it. But after finishing my first Blender project, I wanted to give character design a try and start a project that doesn't follow a tutorial!</p>
   <p className="project-p">Mushie is based off of a mushroom plushie I have, pictured below:</p>
   <img src="images/Blender/Mushie/1.png" alt="mushroom" width="50%" height="50%"    style={{ marginLeft: "30rem",justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}></img>
   <h3>The Process</h3>
   <p className="project-p">Mushie has a lot less details since he's mostly a blob. Given this, I created two ICO spheres and halved and mirrored both to get his body symmetric — perhaps unrealistic body goals, but he's a mushroom, so...</p>
   <p className="project-p">From there, it was mainly a lot of resizing, extruding, intruding, to give him legs, arms, a belly, and some volume. Getting his mushroom cap to an acceptable shape took a lot of vertex manipulating.</p>
   <h3>Extra Details</h3>
   <p className="project-p">I figured he would be cuter with eyes and a blush, so I created more spheres and reshaped them to look like a face. After heavy debate, I also gave him spots on his mushroom cap, which involved flattening and rotating spheres and embedding them into his cap.</p>
   <p className="project-p">The final part involved adding material. Namely, I just added color and adjusted the roughness scale that he wouldn't look too shiny!</p>

   <h3>Final Render</h3>
   <p className="project-p">You know what's next! Lights, cameras... backdrop... For fun, I also rerendered him after adjusting his arms to do a little dancey-dance.</p>

   <h3>Reflection</h3>
   <p className="project-p">I want to tackle animating next! I'd also like to make a garden as my next project and include this little guy somewhere in it. Much more Blender-ing to come!</p>
